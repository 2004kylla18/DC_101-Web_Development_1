      There are times when Im lying in my bed <br>
      How I bellow and cry from this stupid gate <br>
      And my eyes are like windshields on a rainy day <br>
      Almost rubbed-down, swelling <br>
      As I keep on dipping my face in these cold hands of mine <br>
      Heaven knows how embittered I am <br>
      Cause this angel has flown away from me <br>
      Leaving me with drunken misery <br>
      I should have clipped her wings <br>
      And made her mine for all eternity <br>
      Now, this angel has flown away from me <br>
      Thought I had the strength to set her free <br>
      Did what I did because I love her so <br>
      Will she ever find her way back home to me? Oh-oh <br>
      I m so tired,I feel like catching 40 winks <br>
      Being up all night in this elbow room <br>
      That puts me in a trance <br>
      Where hopes and dreams come true <br>
      Now, my lips are burning <br>
      And my eyes are hurting <br>
      From these fumes I make, still, I light another cigarette <br>
      Just to pass my time, oh <br>
      Heaven knows how embittered I am <br>
      Cause this angel has flown away from me <br>
      Leaving me with drunken misery <br>
      I should have clipped her wings <br>
      And made her mine for all eternity <br>
      Now, this angel has flown away from me <br>
      Thought I had the strength to set her free <br>
      Did what I did because I love her so <br>
      Will she ever find her way back home to me Oh-oh <br>
      Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
